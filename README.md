### **Project Description: Health Insurance Purchase Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

#### **Overview**  
This project explores how various **machine learning algorithms** can predict whether a customer will purchase health insurance based on their **age group** and **estimated salary**. By applying multiple classification and regression techniques, we compare model performance and identify patterns in customer decision-making.  

#### **Objective**  
To develop and analyze machine learning models that predict customer behavior in purchasing health insurance using age and salary as key indicators.  

#### **Algorithms Used**  
- **Regression Models**  
- **Classification Models**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Decision Tree**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  

#### **Key Features**  
ðŸ”¹ Data preprocessing and feature selection for optimal model training  
ðŸ”¹ Implementation of multiple ML models for comparison  
ðŸ”¹ **Graphical representation** of results using visualization libraries  
ðŸ”¹ **Prediction scenarios tested:**  
   - Age 30, Salary 87,000  
   - Age 40, No Salary  
   - Age 40, Salary 1,00,000  
   - Age 50, No Salary  

#### **Results & Insights**  
- The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall.  
- Data visualizations help in understanding customer purchasing patterns.  
- The project provides a **comparative analysis of ML models** to determine the best approach for predicting health insurance purchases.  

#### **Tech Stack**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
